Homework 2
I started with a basic navbar from Bootstrap that I customized for me, removing some buttons and renaming the others.

***I wrote a long description that somehow got lost when I tried to save it. I'm going to try to recreated it.

After that I copied to the other pages

Decided on fonts and got the link from google fonts

Wrote some text for the About me page and decided how to present it.
