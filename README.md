# portfolio
Homework 2
I started with a basic navbar from Bootstrap that I customized for me, removing some buttons and renaming the others.

***I wrote a long description that somehow got lost when I tried to save it. I'm going to try to recreated it.

After that I copied to the other pages

Decided on fonts and got the link from google fonts

Wrote some text for the About me page and decided how to present it.

I copied the bootstrap links to all pages.

I did some basic diagram for the look of the pages and then used columns and rows to recreated it on html and css

For the portfolio, I used card and placed them in a basic grid: 3 columsn and 2 rows.

I got the images online, copied them to my assets/image folder and then linked them to the cards.

I spend a lot of time changing design elements like colors, widths, fonts, font sizes, images size and position, and so on.

Also, some time was lost because things didn't work as expected or the look wasn't right, so they got deleted.

The tutor helped me with some fixes and general questions about grids and html.

Even thought I spend time designing, please don't judge this on its aesthetic value, because most of the time was spend trying to get things to work and not enough in actual design.

I used a html verificator and fixed what it found.

Used the inspector to check changes, see where to add margins, padding, etc.

Tried to create some screenshots, but didn't know how to include them in here.
