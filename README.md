# portfolio
Homework 2
I started with a basic navbar from Bootstrap that I customized for me, removing some buttons and renaming the others.

***I wrote a long description that somehow got lost when I tried to save it. I'm going to try to recreated it.

After that I copied to the other pages

Decided on fonts and got the link from google fonts

Wrote some text for the About me page and decided how to present it.

I copied the bootstrap links to all pages.

I did some basic diagram for the look of the pages and then used columns and rows to recreated it on html and css

For the portfolio, I used card and placed them in a basic grid: 3 columsn and 2 rows.

I got the images online, copied them to my assets/image folder and then linked them to the cards.
