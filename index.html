    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="text1">I'm a career changer. I enjoy my actual career but I'm frustrated by the unstability it offers.
        After being laid off twice in the span of a year I decided to look for other options where I could use my skills
        and training, but in a more stable profession. That's why I'm learning Web Development. This is not the end of
        the road for me. I want to continue learning and improving.
    </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>I love doing crafts and I always have a knit (or 3) in the works. I does take me a long time to finish
                them in between all the demands on my time</li>

            <li>I like food and I'm willing to try new things. I also like a pizza or burguers. I enjoy smoking meat
                even though I'm not a pro, just an amateur. And I do it for the enjoyment, not doing it technically,
                which for me would kill the enjoyment.</li>

            <li>I used to sew and made my own clothes. It was something I liked very much when I was younger and more
                free. Lately, I only use my sewing machine for small repairs. Again, time is the issue.
                BTW, no, I'm not sewing masks.
            </li>

            <li>I dibble in gardening. I like to plant things and see them grow. I'm not great in maintenance, so I
                mostly plant perennials and shrubs. I don't have the patienty to be replacing annuals. I'm trying to
                grow a nice hedge at home.</li>

            <li>I'm concerned about the environment and try to recycle, reuse, reduce as much as I can.</li>
