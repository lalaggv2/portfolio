                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <ul>

                    <li>I love doing crafts and I always have a knit (or 3) in the works. I does take me a long time
                        to
                        finish
                        them in between all the demands on my time</li>

                    <li>I like food and I'm willing to try new things. I also like a pizza or burguers. I enjoy
                        smoking meat
                        even though I'm not a pro, just an amateur. And I do it for the enjoyment, not doing it
                        technically,
                        which for me would kill the enjoyment.</li>

                    <li>I used to sew and made my own clothes. It was something I liked very much when I was younger
                        and
                        more
                        free. Lately, I only use my sewing machine for small repairs. Again, time is the issue.
                    </li>

                    <li>I like to look at a nice garden. I like to plant things and see them grow. I'm not great in
                        maintenance, so I
                        mostly plant perennials and shrubs. I don't have the patienty to be replacing annuals. I'm
                        trying to
                        grow a nice hedge at home.</li>

                    <li>I'm concerned about the environment and try to recycle, reuse, reduce as much as I can.</li>

                </ul>

                    <h2>Why?</h2>

                    <p class="text1"> I have always been fascinated by computers. I dabbled in Basic and DOS. That's why
                        I'm learning Web Development. This is not
                        the end
                        of
                        the road for me. I want to continue learning and improving.
                    </p>

                    <p>There are other areas of the technological world where I think I can contribute.</p>
